Small Payloads:
These payloads represent typical data exchanges. They include basic data types such as integers, strings, and booleans. Small payloads help evaluate the performance of your API under normal usage conditions.

Example: A "User" object with basic attributes like ID, username, and email.

Large Payloads:
Large payloads simulate data-intensive requests. These could represent scenarios where users upload files, images, or other complex data structures. This tests how well your API handles processing and data transfer for larger inputs.

Example: Uploading an image file in base64 format.

Nested and Complex Structures:
These payloads have nested data structures, testing APIs that involve multiple layers of relationships. This evaluates the performance of your API's data manipulation and serialization/deserialization.

Example: An "Order" object containing a list of "Product" objects, each with their own attributes.
